## Windows Internals


## Paper/Project

- Not looking for actual research being done, more like preliminary work for a research. this can expand to a capstone, independent study or MS thesis.
- need to put all the sources into one docs so we can find the common things among them.
- we should draw out the common issues the sources talk about and base our paper on that.
- at least 3 themes/topics and figure out the intersections.
    - usability can be main
    - what research involve 2FA
        - how is it use
        - how it works
    - web app
- more about thinking, not much about writing
- Relevant source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_acceptance_model
- sections
    - WILL BE in the wireframe
        - introduction: we need to figure out an idea and introduce it here: what is it? why is it meaningful? tl;dr of how are we gonna do it?
        - background: research that have been done on this, relevant teminologies that we may use in other sections. for example: defining a user with security ability, technical ability, perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, etc.
        - method: the method that we would carry out the research: how we would collect data (survey, questionaires), what research method to use (experimental, correlational, etc.), how we design the experiment (controlled groups, uncontrolled groups), what are the conditions of the experiments.
        - references: didn't talk about it
    - NOT in the wireframe
        - result: pretty much repeating the idea, but since we're gonna implement the web app, we can say here's what we got, it can be use for the future work and actual research
        - future work: pretty much what we would do to actualize this research, I don't really remember all he said about this part.
        - conclusion: not really remember.
- he'll go over more in class
