# Trust and Security Models

- What do you need to trust?

## Trust modeling

- Trust anchor
    - Trust is assumed on this entity, not derived
- Models:
    - Monopoly: 1 trust anchor
    - Oligarchy: multiple, independent trust anchors
    - Anarchy: Everyone is a trust anchor
        - Example: GPG
        - Users make decisions
- Objects of trust
    - Theoretical: crypto algos
    - Design and architectures
    - Implementations: Software/System
- Trust but verify
    - Theoretical, algorithms: Verified through formal proofs
    - Design and architecture: audit
    - Implementation: testing and auditing
- Measure of effectiveness/performance
- Trusted Computing Base
- TCSEC - Orange book
