# Trust and Security Models

- What do you need to trust?

## Trust modeling

- Trust anchor
    - Trust is assumed on this entity, not derived
- Models:
    - Monopoly: 1 trust anchor
    - Oligarchy: multiple, independent trust anchors
    - Anarchy: Everyone is a trust anchor
        - Example: GPG
        - Users make decisions
