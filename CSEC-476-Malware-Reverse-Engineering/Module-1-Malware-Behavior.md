# Malware Behavior

- Downloader: Fetch the actual malware from somewhere else.
- Launcher/loader: Usually self-contain the actual malware and just load it on the system.
- Backdoor:
- Reverse shell:
    - CreateProcess
    - STARTUPINFO struct
    - Multithreaded: 2 pipes, 2 threads
    - Network pipes vs sockets
        - *TODO* more research.
- RAT:
    - The infected hosts are servers.
    - Attackers are clients giving instructions to servers.
- Botnets: Infected hosts also
    - Botnets vs RATs:
        - Mass vs. targeted
        - Many vs. some
        - Botnets are used for attacks but RATs infect the actual victims.
- Credential Stealers.
    - SHA-256 is too fast so it's not used in password hashing? :o
- KeyLoggers
    - SetWindowsHookEx
    - GetAsyncKeyState vs GetKeyState
